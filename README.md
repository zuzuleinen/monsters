# About

I was assigned to create a RESTful API involving a fictional characters game without using any library, framework or copy-paste and this is the result of a week-end work.
Altough it's not perfect I want to keep it like this to see my coding skills at that moment. For more info about the API requests and responses check the controllers.

# Installation instructions

* Run composer install
* Edit `Andrei\App\Config` class with db credentials
